##### Check out the code [here](https://github.com/pooja7b/Data-Science-And-ML/blob/master/collectTweetsFile.py) which stores all tweet information in a file in json format.
##### To store just the tweets' text in a readable format, do [this](https://github.com/pooja7b/Data-Science-And-ML/blob/master/collectTweetsReadable.py).
