### 7. Write program to illustrate user defined module and its usage.
	refer to the solutions of question 8 and 9. The script q8.py has been imported in q9.py.
### 8. Read an input file containing names, roll numbers and marks of 10 students. Each student’s details are present in single line separated by comma. After reading the contents from file, store in a list of dictionary objects variable.
